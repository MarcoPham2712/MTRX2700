Every exercise is separated into its own project. The various parts of these exercises (a, b, c, d) are completed by different members of the group and then put together in the exercise project. Each project has its own main.s file where test cases for each individual part are stored.
The integration exercise project copies all required parts from exercises 1 to 4 and runs in its own main file.
Function comments are presented to show inputs and outputs based on the register used.

## Exercise Responsibilities and Summaries
### Exercise 1 Memory and Pointers
```
Part A: Shirui
Part B: Johnathan
Part C: Shirui
```
In this project we define string functions to convert to lower/upper case, check if a string is a palindrome and perform Caesar ciphers on strings.

### Exercise 2 Digital I/O
```
Part A: Marco, Ben, Johnathan
Part B: Marco, Ben, Johnathan
Part C: Marco, Ben, Johnathan
Part D: Ben
```
We begin by providing a function that can set the LEDs on the STM32F3 Discovery board using a bitmask, then apply it to a function that reads button input to modify that bitmask. We then combine this function with the previous string functions to visually show the number of vowel/consonants in a string.

### Exercise 3 Serial Communication
```
Part A: Marco
Part B: Marco
Part C: Shirui (?)
Part D: Marco
Part E: Marco
```
### Exercise 4 Hardware Timers
```
Part A: Shirui
Part B: Shirui
Part C: Shirui
```
