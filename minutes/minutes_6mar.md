# Meeting 6 March (Week 2)

**Participants:** Johnathan, Marco, Ben, Shirui

**Agenda:**
    Work allocation.
    Upcoming weekly plan.

__Summary__
We split into 2 teams of 2 to work on exercises 1 and 2. This reduces the 'crowdedness' of having 4 people working on the same exercise at the same time.
Johnathan and Shirui will do Ex1. Johnathan will do 1b and write a summary of Ex1 while Shirui will do 1a (already completed) and 1c.
Marco and Ben will do Ex2 together.
