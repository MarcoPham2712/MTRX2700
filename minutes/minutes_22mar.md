**Participants:** Johnathan, Marco, Ben
**Apologies:** Shirui (Visa Medical Appointment)

**Agenda:**
    Work review.
    Work allocation.
    Upcoming weekly plan.

__Summary__
Shirui has completed some of the UART code and we are waiting for him to upload
it to Github. Johnathan has fixed the Caesar Cipher code and Ben has modified
the palindrome code to be case-insensitive. Marco and Johnathan have been
working on the UART while Shirui is away.

We have organised another meeting during the lecture on Monday and hope for
another to discuss the individually written parts of the code so that everybody
is confident enough to explain everything.
