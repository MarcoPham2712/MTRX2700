# Meeting 20 March (Week 4)

**Participants:** Johnathan, Marco, Ben, Shirui

**Agenda:**
    Work review.
    Work allocation.
    Upcoming weekly plan.

__Summary__
Ben and Johnathan have created a framework for the integration code and are
waiting on UART to be completed. We have organised a meeting at Saturday noon
where we will work on the rest of the assignment in the PNR. This ensures we
have enough time to hold another meeting if we do not complete the task on
Saturday.
